class WindowGlobalTargetActor extends BaseTargetActor {
  /**
   * WindowGlobalTargetActor is the target actor to debug (HTML) documents.
   *
   * WindowGlobal's are the Gecko representation for a given document's window object.
   * It relates to a given nsGlobalWindowInner instance.
   *
   * The main goal of this class is to expose the target-scoped actors being registered
   * via `ActorRegistry.registerModule` and manage their lifetimes. In addition, this
   * class also tracks the lifetime of the targeted window global.
   *
   * ### Main requests:
   *
   * `detach`:
   *  Stop document watching and cleanup everything that the target and its children actors created.
   *  It ultimately lead to destroy the target actor.
   * `switchToFrame`:
   *  Change the targeted document of the whole actor, and its child target-scoped actors
   *  to an iframe or back to its original document.
   *
   * Most properties (like `chromeEventHandler` or `docShells`) are meant to be
   * used by the various child target actors.
   *
   * ### RDP events:
   *
   *  - `tabNavigated`:
   *    Sent when the window global is about to navigate or has just navigated
   *    to a different document.
   *    This event contains the following attributes:
   *     * url (string)
   *       The new URI being loaded.
   *     * state (string)
   *       `start` if we just start requesting the new URL
   *       `stop`  if the new URL is done loading
   *     * isFrameSwitching (boolean)
   *       Indicates the event is dispatched when switching the actor context to a
   *       different frame. When we switch to an iframe, there is no document
   *       load. The targeted document is most likely going to be already done
   *       loading.
   *     * title (string)
   *       The document title being loaded. (sent only on state=stop)
   *
   *  - `frameUpdate`:
   *    Sent when there was a change in the child frames contained in the document
   *    or when the actor's context was switched to another frame.
   *    This event can have four different forms depending on the type of change:
   *    * One or many frames are updated:
   *      { frames: [{ id, url, title, parentID }, ...] }
   *    * One frame got destroyed:
   *      { frames: [{ id, destroy: true }]}
   *    * All frames got destroyed:
   *      { destroyAll: true }
   *    * We switched the context of the actor to a specific frame:
   *      { selected: #id }
   *
   * ### Internal, non-rdp events:
   *
   * Various events are also dispatched on the actor itself without being sent to
   * the client. They all relate to the documents tracked by this target actor
   * (its main targeted document, but also any of its iframes):
   *  - will-navigate
   *    This event fires once navigation starts. All pending user prompts are
   *    dealt with, but it is fired before the first request starts.
   *  - navigate
   *    This event is fired once the document's readyState is "complete".
   *  - window-ready
   *    This event is fired in various distinct scenarios:
   *     * When a new Window object is crafted, equivalent of `DOMWindowCreated`.
   *       It is dispatched before any page script is executed.
   *     * We will have already received a window-ready event for this window
   *       when it was created, but we received a window-destroyed event when
   *       it was frozen into the bfcache, and now the user navigated back to
   *       this page, so it's now live again and we should resume handling it.
   *     * For each existing document, when an `attach` request is received.
   *       At this point scripts in the page will be already loaded.
   *     * When `swapFrameLoaders` is used, such as with moving window globals
   *       between windows or toggling Responsive Design Mode.
   *  - window-destroyed
   *    This event is fired in two cases:
   *     * When the window object is destroyed, i.e. when the related document
   *       is garbage collected. This can happen when the window global is
   *       closed or the iframe is removed from the DOM.
   *       It is equivalent of `inner-window-destroyed` event.
   *     * When the page goes into the bfcache and gets frozen.
   *       The equivalent of `pagehide`.
   *  - changed-toplevel-document
   *    This event fires when we switch the actor's targeted document
   *    to one of its iframes, or back to its original top document.
   *    It is dispatched between window-destroyed and window-ready.
   *
   * Note that *all* these events are dispatched in the following order
   * when we switch the context of the actor to a given iframe:
   *  - will-navigate
   *  - window-destroyed
   *  - changed-toplevel-document
   *  - window-ready
   *  - navigate
   *
   * This class is subclassed by ParentProcessTargetActor and others.
   * Subclasses are expected to implement a getter for the docShell property.
   *
   * @param conn DevToolsServerConnection
   *        The conection to the client.
   * @param options Object
   *        Object with following attributes:
   *        - docShell nsIDocShell
   *          The |docShell| for the debugged frame.
   *        - followWindowGlobalLifeCycle Boolean
   *          If true, the target actor will only inspect the current WindowGlobal (and its children windows).
   *          But won't inspect next document loaded in the same BrowsingContext.
   *          The actor will behave more like a WindowGlobalTarget rather than a BrowsingContextTarget.
   *          This is always true for Tab and web extension debugging, but not yet for parent process target
   *          used by the browser toolbox.
   *        - isTopLevelTarget Boolean
   *          Should be set to true for all top-level targets. A top level target
   *          is the topmost target of a DevTools "session". For instance for a local
   *          tab toolbox, the WindowGlobalTargetActor for the content page is the top level target.
   *          For the Multiprocess Browser Toolbox, the parent process target is the top level
   *          target.
   *          At the moment this only impacts the WindowGlobalTarget `reconfigure`
   *          implementation. But for server-side target switching this flag will be exposed
   *          to the client and should be available for all target actor classes. It will be
   *          used to detect target switching. (Bug 1644397)
   *        - ignoreSubFrames Boolean
   *          If true, the actor will only focus on the passed docShell and not on the whole
   *          docShell tree. This should be enabled when we have targets for all documents.
   *        - sessionContext Object
   *          The Session Context to help know what is debugged.
   *          See devtools/server/actors/watcher/session-context.js
